## Library Requirements

We'll be using the following libraries to complete our classification problem:

-  **Numpy** - For linear algebra operations
-  **Pandas** - To create DataFrame, CSV files, etc
-  **Seaborn** - For sophisticated visualization
-  **Pickle** - To save and load binary files of our training data
-  **Scikit-Learn** - Machine learning framework. We have used this for evaluating our Classifier and for cross-validation split
-  **Matplotlib** - To visualize images, losses and accuracy
-  **Plotly** - to visalize interactice data
